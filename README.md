# GUI Installer for Arch Linux built using QT
Open the project, build it and voila. 
You can simply clone this repository, then open it with QT Creator or KDE. If you use a windows system, you can only see the UI. If you are using a Linux system, you need to be more careful, as it can actually install Arch Linux in your system.
